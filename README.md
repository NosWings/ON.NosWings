ON.NosWings is our old OpenNos fork to get NosWings server running.

This project is not production ready nor maintained anymore.

# We are back on Nostale Scene, with our new brand emulator, written from scratch with latest technologies and completely different from OpenNos !
# [Our Website](https://noswings.com)

# Follow our new project : [ChickenAPI](https://github.com/BlowaXD/ChickenAPI)

## Who are we 

We are a bunch of enthusiast who decided to make their own fork of OpenNos, modifying a lot of things designed for our needs.

## Why don't we maintain OpenNos ?

As we've already told numerous time, OpenNos has proven its capacity and its limitation.

We are in 2018, our needs are not the same as at the beginning of OpenNos, that's why we decide to use more recent technologies and a more mature software architecture.

## Do not forget !

Please, do not forget to mention that you are using someone's work. /!\
